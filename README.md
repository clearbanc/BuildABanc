Experience How To Build A Banc, From Scratch!

Clearbanc is building the Banc of tommorow and needs your help! We have an amazing backend but our users keep complaining that the interface is from the early 90s. We need you to craft a proper UI using the latest and greatest of Javascript Technologies (EMBER). https://www.emberjs.com/

For this test we are looking for an application with the following requirments, how you implement them is up to you.

1) Single Page Ember Applicaiton (No Extra Routes Required)
2) Ability to Show, Deposit, and Withdraw funds (We are taking the users word for this...)
3) Ability to see a ledger of transactions

BONUS
1) Ability to take out a cash advance with a fixed fee (Not an Interest Rate)
2) Advance should deposit into user's account
3) Advance Liability should be tracked on ledger

This application does not need to be hosted, it can remain local. No api calls or backends are required, we don't care that the data does not persist after the session closes. You also do not need to provide any form of user authentication, assume the session already exists.

Good luck, and good Bancing!
